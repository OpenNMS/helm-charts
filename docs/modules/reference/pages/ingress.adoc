= Ingress

Using Ingress facilitates access to the OpenNMS UI and Grafana.
Ingress is not required, although it is a good thing to have.
//external dependencies says it is.
You could modify the Helm Chart to avoid Ingress altogether (or make it optional) and expose the WebUIs via `LoadBalancer` or `NodePort` services, but that won't be covered here.

For example, when deploying the Helm Chart names `acme` (remember about the rules for the `namespace`) with a value of `k8s.agalue.net` for the `domain`, it would create an Ingress instance exposing the following resources via custom FQDNs:

* OpenNMS UI (read-only): `onms.acme.k8s.agalue.net`
* OpenNMS Core: `onms-core.acme.k8s.agalue.net`
* Grafana: `grafana.acme.k8s.agalue.net`

If you get a certificate error with Chrome in a local cluster because you don't have a valid certificate, see https://cybercafe.dev/thisisunsafe-bypassing-chrome-security-warnings/[thisisunsafe - Bypassing chrome security warnings].

If you get a too many redirects error, try putting the path `/opennms/login.jsp` at the end of the OpenNMS UI URL to log in.
You might be running into problem related to https://issues.opennms.org/browse/NMS-13901[NMS-13901].

To customize behavior, you could pass custom annotations via `ingress.annotations` when deploying the Helm Chart.

Note that it is expected to have https://cert-manager.io/docs/[cert-manager] deployed on your Kubernetes cluster, as that would be used to manage the certificates (configured via `ingress.certManager.clusterIssuer`).
