= About OpenNMS Helm Charts

OpenNMS Helm Charts makes it easier for users to run OpenNMS Horizon locally in a Kubernetes cluster.
It is not yet available for a Cloud environment.

Each deployment through OpenNMS Helm Charts has a single Core server, with options for Grafana, a custom Ingress that shares the RRD files and some configuration files, and/or multiple Sentinels for flow processing.

Note that this is one way to approach the solution.
We recommend that you study the content of the Helm chart and tune it for your needs.

== Architecture

The following illustrates the general architecture for the OpenNMS Helm Charts solution, with a Kubernetes container environment, ingress controller, and three unique namespaces.
It also displays external dependencies: Loki, PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, Kafka, and Cortex.
For more detailed information on Kubernetes and containerized environments, see the https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/[Kubernetes documentation].

.Customer namespace deployment

image::about/helm-charts-diagrams002.png["Customer Namespace Deployment Diagram", 500]

Deployment in each namespace includes OpenNMS Horizon Core with application scripts and configuration files.
Optionally, you can include OpenNMS Sentinel, Grafana, Kafka, Mimir, and Elasticsearch services.
All components on a single `namespace` represent a single OpenNMS environment or customer deployment or a single tenant.
The name of the `namespace` is used as follows:

* A customer/deployment identifier.
* The name of the deployed Helm application.
* A prefix for the OpenNMS and Grafana databases in PostgreSQL.
* A prefix for the index names in Elasticsearch when processing flows.
* A prefix for the topics in Kafka.
* A prefix for the Consumer Group IDs in OpenNMS.
* Part of the subdomain used by the Ingress Controller to expose Web UIs.

//removed shared volumes, as it included `storageClass` which is going away, and also Cloud options which we aren't documenting for 32.

== Design

The solution is based and tested against the latest Horizon.
It is not currently available for Meridian.

=== Scripts and core configuration

Due to how the current Docker images were designed and implemented, the solution requires multiple specialized scripts to configure each application properly.
You could build your images and move the logic from the scripts executed via `initContainers` to your custom entry point script and simplify the Helm Chart.

The scripts configure only a certain number of things.
Each deployment would likely need additional configuration, which is the main reason for using a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) for the configuration directory of the Core OpenNMS instance.

One advantage of configuring that volume is allowing backups and access to the files without accessing the OpenNMS instances running in Kubernetes.

=== Time series databases

Multiple time series strategies are supported and you can switch from one to another as needed.
Note that when switching strategies existing data is not migrated and you will experience loss of persisted metrics.

=== Scaling

To alleviate load from OpenNMS, you can optionally start Sentinel instances for flow processing.
This requires having an Elasticsearch cluster available.
When Sentinels are present, Telemetryd is disabled in OpenNMS.

The OpenNMS Core and Sentinels are backed by a `StatefulSet`, but keep in mind that there can be one and only one Core instance.
To have multiple Sentinels, make sure you have enough partitions for the flow topics in your Kafka clusters, as all of them would be part of the same consumer group.

=== Log files and Grafana Loki

The current OpenNMS instances are not friendly when accessing log files.
The Helm Chart allows you to configure https://grafana.com/oss/loki/[Grafana Loki] to centralize all the log messages.
When the Loki server is configured, the Core instance and the Sentinel instances will forward logs to Loki.
The current solution employs the sidecar pattern using https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/clients/promtail/[Grafana Promtail] to deliver the logs.

=== Docker images

You can customize all of the Docker images via Helm Values.
The solution lets you configure custom Docker registries to access your custom images  when all the images you plan to use will not be in Docker Hub or when your Kubernetes cluster will not have internet access.
Keep in mind that your custom images should be based on those currently in use.

=== Plugins

Containers are bundled with default plugins.
You can add additional plugins by building your own container image (see https://github.com/OpenNMS/helm-charts/blob/main/kar-container/README.md[kar-container] for an example).

=== External dependencies

The Helm Chart assumes that all external dependencies are running somewhere else.
None of them would be initialized or maintained here.
Those are Loki, PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, Kafka, and Cortex (when applied).
The solution provides a script to start up a set of dependencies for testing as a part of the same cluster but **this is not intended for production use.**
