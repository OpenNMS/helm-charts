= Manual Configuration Changes
:description: Learn how to make manual configuration changes to OpenNMS Helm Charts on Kubernetes.

Either access the OpenNMS container via a remote shell through `kubectl`, and edit the file using vi (the only editor available within the OpenNMS container).

Send the reload configuration event via `send-event.pl` or the Karaf Shell (not accessible within the container).

In case OpenNMS has to be restarted, delete the Pod (not the StatefulSet), and the Kubernetes controller will recreate it again.
