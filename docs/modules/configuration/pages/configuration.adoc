= Customize OpenNMS settings

If you want to make changes to the `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/etc` config files, you can access the OpenNMS container via a remote shell through `kubectl`, and edit the file using vi (the only editor available within the OpenNMS container).
See the xref:reference:tools.adoc#inspector[inspector] docs if you want to access and edit config files while the OpenNMS container is offline.


If you change config files while OpenNMS is running, you can send a reload configuration event via the usual methods.
See the link:https://docs.opennms.com/horizon/latest/operation/deep-dive/admin/configuration/daemon-config-files.html[Horizon documentation] for details on how to send a reload command and xref:reference:tools.adoc[useful commands] for tips on connecting to the container shell.

In cases where you need to restart OpenNMS, delete the Pod (not the StatefulSet), and the Kubernetes controller will recreate it.
