# OpenNMS Helm Charts -- Horizon

If your organization uses Kubernetes or Red Hat OpenShift, OpenNMS makes a Helm chart available to simplify deployment of Horizon and Meridian.

Note that this is one way to approach the solution.
We recommend that you study the content of the Helm chart and tune it for your needs.

For more information about deploying in a containerized environment, including requirements and external dependencies, refer to [Containerized Deployment](https://docs.opennms.com/horizon/latest/deployment/core/containers.html) in the main product documentation.

If you are not already familiar with Horizon or Meridian, we recommend reviewing our product documentation ([Horizon](https://docs.opennms.com/horizon/latest/deployment/core/introduction.html), [Meridian](https://docs.opennms.com/meridian/latest/deployment/core/introduction.html)) and our [Horizon](https://www.opennms.com/horizon/) or [Meridian](https://www.opennms.com/meridian/) websites.

## Quick Start

Use the following commands to bring up an instance of Horizon for testing:

```
helm repo add opennms https://opennms.github.io/helm-charts

helm install monms opennms/horizon --set domain=domain1.com  --create-namespace
```

## Version compatibility
